    "useMerchantCode": "How to Use Merchant Code",
    "useMerchantCodeContent": "To use a merchant code, consumers need to scan the code using the D9 Merchant Alliance app. The system will recognize and verify the code.

    "usePointGift": "How to Gift Points",
    "usePointGiftContent": "To gift points, merchants purchase points through the D9 Merchant Alliance platform and then distribute them to specific consumers or groups via the backend system.
